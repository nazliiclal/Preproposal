# Preproposal


## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Our final project idea is to make a Pokedex. We will ask the user to 
input a number, (1 to 51 minimum or 151 maximum) then we will display the information of the corresponding pokemon according the gen 1 list. The information displayed would be: name, strength, and power. More information can be added if need be. Then weÕll ask the user: ÒDo you want this character or do you want to change.Ó Depending on his/her answer, the user will choose a character and  a weapon. Then, by importing random, the computer will have its own character and weapon. And at the end, these two characters will fight with their own weapon, and weÕll output who the winner is.



## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Sofia Cordero and Matt Burkhimer



## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is this idea ok for the final project, do we need to add anything else?
